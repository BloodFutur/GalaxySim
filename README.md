# Galaxy simulation (3D)

This project simulates a galaxy using the Barnes-Hut algorithm

# The Barnes-Hut Approximation

Speed up calculations to O(nlogn) instead of O(nÂ²) for the native algorithm

1. Construct the spatial index : quadtree in 2D (octree in 3d)
Each square can only have 0 or 1 point

2. Calculate centers of mass
Calculate center of mass of each cell

3. F=-G(mm/d^2) and F=ma

# How to launch it
Compile it using qmake: `qmake GalaxySim.pro`
Run it on your terminal : `./GalaxySim`
