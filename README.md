Galaxy simulation (3D)

This project simulate a galaxy using the Barnes-Hut algorithm

The Barnes-Hut Approximation

Speed up calculations to O(nlogn) instead of O(nÂ²) for the native algorithm

1. Construct the spatial index : octree
2. Calculate centers of mass
3. Estimate forces

1. Construct the spatial index : quadtree in 2D (octree in 3d)
Each square can only have 0 or 1 point

2. Calculate centers of mass
Calculate center of mass of each cell

3. F=-G(mm/d^2) and F=ma
